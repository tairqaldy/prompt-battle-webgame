# Sprint 2 - Final Report: Complete Game Implementation

## üéØ **Sprint Overview**
**Duration**: Sprint 2  
**Goal**: Complete the Prompt Battle WebGame implementation with working image display, scoring system, and multiplayer functionality  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

## üöÄ **Major Achievements**

### ‚úÖ **1. Image Loading System - FIXED**
**Problem**: Images were not displaying in daily challenge or multiplayer rounds  
**Root Cause**: Incorrect image path handling and missing error handling  
**Solution Implemented**:
- Fixed image path extraction from CSV dataset (`images/0/custom_0_0.png` ‚Üí `custom_0_0.png`)
- Enhanced image serving endpoint with proper CORS headers and error handling
- Added comprehensive image loading states with visual feedback
- Implemented fallback UI for failed image loads with retry functionality

**Code Changes**:
```javascript
// Backend: Fixed image path handling
const filename = path.basename(entry.image_file);
const imagePath = `/api/images/${filename}`;

// Frontend: Enhanced image loading with states
imageElement.onload = () => {
    console.log('Image loaded successfully:', imagePath);
    loadingDiv.remove();
    imageElement.style.display = 'block';
};
```

### ‚úÖ **2. Round Ending Logic - FIXED**
**Problem**: Rounds didn't end when all players submitted their prompts  
**Root Cause**: Missing logic to check for complete submissions  
**Solution Implemented**:
- Added submission tracking in `submit-prompt` handler
- Implemented early round ending when all players submit
- Maintained timer fallback for incomplete submissions
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging

**Code Changes**:
```javascript
// Check if all players have submitted
if (allSubmissions.length >= playerCount) {
    console.log('All players submitted, ending round early');
    await endRound(roomCode, roundId);
    return;
}
```

### ‚úÖ **3. Complete Scoring System - IMPLEMENTED**
**Problem**: Scoring wasn't working properly in-game and daily challenge  
**Solution Implemented**:
- **Enhanced Scoring Algorithm**: 100+ semantic keywords across 7 categories
- **Live Leaderboards**: Real-time scoring updates during multiplayer games
- **Detailed Feedback**: Shows matched/missed words with emojis and tips
- **Round Results**: Proper scoring display after each round
- **Daily Challenge Scoring**: Complete scoring with detailed explanations
- **Cumulative Scoring**: Tracks total scores across multiple rounds

**Scoring Features**:
- Semantic matching for people, actions, objects, styles, colors, settings, time
- Word overlap detection with exact matches and synonyms
- Length bonus for appropriate prompt length
- Order bonus for maintaining word order
- Detailed feedback with learning tips

### ‚úÖ **4. Host Controls & Room Management - FIXED**
**Problem**: Host couldn't see room code, start game, or customize settings  
**Solution Implemented**:
- Fixed host status detection and display logic
- Added prominent room code display with copy functionality
- Implemented comprehensive room settings customization
- Added proper host/guest UI switching

**Room Settings**:
- **Rounds**: 3, 5, or 10 rounds
- **Time per Round**: 60, 90, or 120 seconds
- **Character Limit**: 100, 150, or 200 characters
- **Room Code**: Easy copying and sharing

### ‚úÖ **5. Complete Game Flow - IMPLEMENTED**
**Following the flowchart exactly**:
- ‚úÖ **Image Selection**: Random images from dataset with proper paths
- ‚úÖ **Image Display**: Images show correctly in both modes
- ‚úÖ **Prompt Submission**: Players can submit prompts with character limits
- ‚úÖ **Auto-save**: Prompts are saved as players type
- ‚úÖ **Round Ending**: Ends when all players submit OR timer expires
- ‚úÖ **Scoring Pipeline**: Tokenization, semantic matching, weighted scoring
- ‚úÖ **Results Display**: Shows rankings, scores, and detailed feedback
- ‚úÖ **Game Progression**: Proper round progression and final results
