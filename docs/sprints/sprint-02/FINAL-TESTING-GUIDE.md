## 🚨 **If Issues Persist**

```

### **Common Issues & Solutions**
1. **"Cannot find module"** → Run `npm install` in backend folder

Press F12 → Console tab to see any JavaScript errors

✅ Prompt submitted: "A person climbing mountains..."
✅ Results calculated: Score 85/100
✅ Complete game flow working
```

### **Database Verification**:
Check `backend/prompt_battle.db` exists and contains:
- `rooms` table with party data
- `players` table with player names
- `rounds` table with game rounds
- `submissions` table with prompts
- `results` table with scores
