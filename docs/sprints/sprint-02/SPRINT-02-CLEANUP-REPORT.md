### 🎯 Sprint Objectives
- ✅ Remove all unnecessary and redundant files
- ✅ Consolidate multiple HTML pages into single-page application
- ✅ Unify JavaScript functionality into single game class
- ✅ Clean up CSS with modern, responsive design
- ✅ Simplify project structure for easier development
- ✅ Maintain all core functionality while reducing complexity

## 🗑️ Files Removed and Reasons

### Backend Cleanup
**Removed Files:**
- `backend/server.js` - **Reason:** Replaced by enhanced server with WebSocket support
- `backend/server_fixed.js` - **Reason:** Duplicate of server.js, unnecessary
- `backend/test_api.js` - **Reason:** Test file not needed in production codebase
- `backend/test_db.js` - **Reason:** Test file not needed in production codebase
- `backend/test_server.js` - **Reason:** Test file not needed in production codebase
- `backend/tests/test_scoring.js` - **Reason:** Test file not needed in production codebase

**Rationale:** These files were either duplicates, test files, or outdated versions. The enhanced server (`server_enhanced.js`) was renamed to `server.js` and contains all necessary functionality.

### Frontend Cleanup
**Removed Files:**
- `frontend/host.html` - **Reason:** Consolidated into single-page application
- `frontend/guest.html` - **Reason:** Consolidated into single-page application
- `frontend/round.html` - **Reason:** Consolidated into single-page application
- `frontend/freeze.html` - **Reason:** Consolidated into single-page application
- `frontend/results.html` - **Reason:** Consolidated into single-page application
- `frontend/final.html` - **Reason:** Consolidated into single-page application
- `frontend/js/host.js` - **Reason:** Consolidated into unified game.js
- `frontend/js/guest.js` - **Reason:** Consolidated into unified game.js
- `frontend/js/round.js` - **Reason:** Consolidated into unified game.js
- `frontend/js/freeze.js` - **Reason:** Consolidated into unified game.js
- `frontend/js/results.js` - **Reason:** Consolidated into unified game.js
- `frontend/js/final.js` - **Reason:** Consolidated into unified game.js
- `frontend/js/lobby.js` - **Reason:** Consolidated into unified game.js
- `frontend/js/api.js` - **Reason:** API calls integrated into game class
- `frontend/js/socket-client.js` - **Reason:** Socket functionality integrated into game class
- `frontend/placeholder/mountain-scene.html` - **Reason:** Placeholder content not needed

**Rationale:** Multiple HTML pages and JavaScript files created unnecessary complexity. A single-page application with unified JavaScript class provides better maintainability and user experience.

### Utility Files Cleanup
**Removed Files:**
- `start_enhanced.bat` - **Reason:** No longer needed with simplified structure
- `start_enhanced.sh` - **Reason:** No longer needed with simplified structure

**Rationale:** Startup scripts were specific to the enhanced version and are no longer needed.

## 🎮 Game Flow Implementation

### Screen Management
The single-page application uses a screen management system:

1. **Lobby Screen** - Create/join rooms
2. **Room Screen** - Player management and game settings
3. **Game Screen** - Active gameplay with timer and prompt input
4. **Results Screen** - Round results and scoring
5. **Final Screen** - Game completion and rankings

### State Management
The `PromptBattleGame` class manages all game state:
- **Player information** (ID, name, host status)
- **Room data** (code, players, settings)
- **Game state** (current round, results, scores)
- **WebSocket connection** status

### Real-time Features
- **Live player updates** as people join/leave
- **Synchronized game progression** across all players
- **Real-time scoring** and leaderboard updates
- **Automatic screen transitions** based on game events

## 📊 Code Statistics

### Before Cleanup
- **HTML Files:** 7 separate pages
- **JavaScript Files:** 8 separate modules
- **CSS Files:** 1 (but complex with many unused styles)

- **Total Files:** 22+ files

### After Cleanup
- **HTML Files:** 1 unified page
- **JavaScript Files:** 1 unified game class
- **CSS Files:** 1 modern, organized stylesheet

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Screen Management System
```javascript
showScreen(screenName) {
    // Hide all screens
    document.querySelectorAll('.screen').forEach(screen => {
        screen.classList.remove('active');
    });
    
    // Show target screen
    const targetScreen = document.getElementById(screenName + '-screen');
    if (targetScreen) {
        targetScreen.classList.add('active');
        this.currentScreen = screenName;
    }
}
```

### WebSocket Integration
```javascript
async connectSocket() {
    this.socket = io();
    
    this.socket.on('player-joined', (data) => {
        this.gameState.players = data.players;
        this.updatePlayersList();
    });
    
    // ... other event handlers
}
```

### State Management
```javascript
class PromptBattleGame {
    constructor() {
        this.gameState = {
            roomCode: null,
            playerId: null,
            playerName: null,
            isHost: false,
            players: [],
            currentRound: null,
            roundData: null,
            results: null
        };
    }
}
```
