# Sprint 02 - Backend API Development & Game Logic Implementation

**Date:** September 11, 2025  
**Duration:** 1 Day  
**Sprint Goal:** Implement complete backend API and game logic to make the UI functional

---

## 🎯 Sprint Objectives

### Primary Goals
- ✅ Implement room management APIs (create, join, leave)
- ✅ Implement player management APIs (add, remove, list)
- ✅ Implement game state management (start, progress, end)
- ✅ Implement scoring algorithm for prompt comparison
- ✅ Connect frontend to backend APIs
- ✅ Add real-time game features with polling

### Secondary Goals
- ✅ Add input validation and error handling
- ✅ Implement game session persistence
- ✅ Add basic security measures
- ✅ Create API documentation

---

## 📋 Backend API Endpoints to Implement

### Room Management
- `POST /api/rooms` - Create new room
- `GET /api/rooms/:code` - Get room details
- `POST /api/rooms/:code/join` - Join room
- `POST /api/rooms/:code/leave` - Leave room
- `DELETE /api/rooms/:code` - Delete room (host only)

### Player Management
- `GET /api/rooms/:code/players` - Get room players
- `POST /api/rooms/:code/players` - Add player to room
- `DELETE /api/rooms/:code/players/:playerId` - Remove player (host only)

### Game Management
- `POST /api/rooms/:code/start` - Start game
- `GET /api/rooms/:code/status` - Get game status
- `GET /api/rooms/:code/rounds/:roundId` - Get round details
- `POST /api/rounds/:roundId/submit` - Submit prompt

### Results & Scoring
- `GET /api/rounds/:roundId/results` - Get round results
- `GET /api/rooms/:code/final-results` - Get final game results

## 🏗️ Technical Implementation Plan

### 1. Database Layer Enhancements
- Add helper functions for common queries
- Implement data validation
- Add transaction support for game state changes

### 2. API Layer
- Express route handlers for all endpoints
- Request/response validation
- Error handling middleware
- CORS configuration

### 3. Game Logic
- Room state management
- Round progression logic
- Player turn management
- Scoring algorithm implementation

### 4. Frontend Integration
- Update JavaScript modules to call APIs
- Add loading states and error handling
- Implement real-time updates with polling
- Form validation and user feedback

## 📊 Success Criteria

### Must Have
- [ ] All API endpoints functional
- [ ] Complete game flow working (create room → join → play → results)
- [ ] Scoring algorithm working
- [ ] Frontend connected to backend
- [ ] Basic error handling

### Should Have
- [ ] Real-time updates working
- [ ] Input validation on all forms
- [ ] Game state persistence
- [ ] Basic security measures

### Nice to Have
- [ ] API documentation
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Advanced error handling
- [ ] Game analytics

## 🚀 Implementation Order

1. **Database Helpers** - Create utility functions for database operations
2. **Room APIs** - Implement room creation and management
3. **Player APIs** - Implement player management
4. **Game Logic** - Implement game state and round management
5. **Scoring Algorithm** - Implement prompt comparison scoring
6. **Frontend Integration** - Connect UI to APIs
7. **Real-time Features** - Add polling for live updates
8. **Testing & Validation** - Test complete game flow

---

## 📝 Notes

- Focus on MVP functionality first
- Keep APIs simple and RESTful
- Use polling instead of WebSockets for simplicity
- Implement basic scoring algorithm (can be enhanced later)
- Ensure all error cases are handled gracefully
