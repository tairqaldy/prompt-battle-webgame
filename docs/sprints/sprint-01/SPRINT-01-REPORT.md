## 🔧 Technical Solutions

### Problem: SQLite3 Installation Issues
**Challenge**: `better-sqlite3` required Python build tools on Windows  
**Solution**: Switched to standard `sqlite3` package with callback-based API  
**Result**: Clean installation and database initialization

### Problem: Wireframe Implementation
**Challenge**: Converting hand-drawn sketches to functional web interfaces  
**Solution**: Direct HTML/CSS implementation with careful attention to layout details  
**Result**: Pixel-perfect recreation of all 7 screens

### Problem: Interactive Functionality
**Challenge**: Implementing JavaScript interactions without frameworks  
**Solution**: Vanilla ES6 modules with global function exports for inline handlers  
**Result**: Smooth user interactions and navigation
