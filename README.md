## üéØ Project Overview

**Prompt Battle WebGame** is a real-time multiplayer game that challenges players to reverse-engineer AI image generation prompts. As a Software Engineering student at Fontys ICT, I developed this project to explore the intersection of artificial intelligence, game development, and modern web technologies. The game combines competitive gameplay with educational elements, helping players understand how AI interprets and generates visual content.

## üé• DEMO Video

### üéÆ The Core Concept

Players are presented with AI-generated images and must guess the original prompt used to create them. It's like "reverse Pictionary" - instead of drawing what you see, you describe what you see in terms that an AI image generator would understand. The game tests players' ability to think like an AI system while competing against friends in real-time.

### üè´ Academic Context

This project serves as my **Project #1** for Fontys ICT, demonstrating proficiency in multiple learning outcomes across software development, AI integration, and game design. The project showcases full-stack development skills, real-time communication, database management, and user experience design.
